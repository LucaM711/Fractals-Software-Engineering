Fractal Zoomer

## Introduction

Fractal Zoomer is an interactive application designed to allow users to explore fractals, focusing on the Mandelbrot Set. This project provides an infinite zoom feature, enabling users to explore the intricate patterns that emerge as they zoom deeper into fractals. The application is built using web technologies, ensuring a responsive and immersive experience.

## Features

- **Infinite Zoom**: Users can zoom infinitely into fractals, observing the endless patterns that emerge deeper in the Mandelbrot set.
- **Interactive Navigation**: The interface allows users to easily zoom in and out, exploring areas of interest within the fractal.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: As the user zooms, the fractal is dynamically rendered in real time, ensuring a smooth experience.
- **Customization**: Users can change color schemes, adjust zoom speed, and explore different visual settings to personalize the experience.
- **Mandelbrot Set Focus**: Explore the famous Mandelbrot set, known for its fractal patterns.

## Requirements

To run the fractal generation code, you'll need to install the following libraries:

1. **`matplotlib`** - For plotting and visualizing the fractals.
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
2. **`numpy`** - For numerical operations and handling arrays.
 ```bash
pip install numpy
